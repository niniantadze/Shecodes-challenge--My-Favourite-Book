      <div class="big-description">
        <p>
          From one of our boldest, most celebrated new literary voices, a novel
          about a young woman‚Äôs efforts to duck the ills of the world by
          embarking on an extended hibernation with the help of one of the worst
          psychiatrists in the annals of literature and the battery of medicines
          she prescribes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the story of a year spent under the influence of a truly mad
          combination of drugs designed to heal our heroine from her alienation
          from this world, Moshfegh shows us how reasonable, even necessary,
          alienation can be. Both tender and blackly funny, merciless and
          compassionate, it is a showcase for the gifts of one of our major
          writers working at the height of her powers.
